# 🏥 Decentralized Health Records & Emergency Access Application  
A secure, blockchain-powered medical record system enhanced with AI for emergency decision support, risk prediction, and decentralized patient data ownership.

This project solves the problem of **centralized, insecure, and slow medical record systems** by offering a **tamper-proof**, **patient-controlled**, and **AI-augmented** digital health record platform.

# 📍 Overview
Traditional health data systems store patient records in centralized databases, which makes them vulnerable to:

- Unauthorized access  
- Single-point failures  
- Delayed emergency response  
- Tampering or manipulation  

This project uses **Blockchain**, **AI**, and **Decentralized Storage (IPFS)** to empower patients with control over their data while enabling doctors and emergency responders to access essential information securely and instantly.

---

# 🎯 Objectives
- Provide **secure, immutable** record storage using blockchain  
- Give **data ownership back to patients**  
- Enable **AI-powered** risk assessment & emergency health summaries  
- Enable doctors to access patient info **only with permission**  
- Provide decentralized storage using **IPFS**  
- Ensure transparent and auditable access using **smart contracts**

---

# ⭐ Key Features
### 🔐 **1. Blockchain-secured medical records**
- Encrypt records → store encrypted file on IPFS  
- Store hash on blockchain → ensures immutability  

### 👤 **2. Patient-controlled access**
- Smart contracts manage who can view/edit records  
- Doctors must request access → patient approves  

### 🚨 **3. Emergency access mode**
- Doctors/emergency responders can access “Emergency Summary” using blockchain-verified access  

### 🧠 **4. AI-powered risk prediction**
- AI model predicts risk level based on vitals  
- Helps in quick decision-making during emergencies  

### 🏥 **5. Modern web dashboard**
- React frontend  
- Patient dashboard, doctor dashboard, emergency panel
